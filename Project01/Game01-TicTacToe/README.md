## Description :

This web version of the classical game Tic Tac Toe was built in hopes of achieving the project goal of understanding the basics of approaching real world problems, basic interaction and user behaivor.

## Built with :

- HTML5
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

## Additional Libraries :

- [Sweet Alert ](https://sweetalert.js.org/)
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Approach :

First, it was understanding the game logic, rules and winning conditions . After establishing the main game tile or "zones" , I tried to understand the interaction that will take place on each of them and turned it into events. Mainly this was hard coding , and later on tried different ways to write it .

## Challenges:

Since the main interaction is the same for both players, figuring out how to not override those events repeatedly by disabling the current player's turn once it is done .

## What's next:

The main upcoming futures is allowing online multiplayer and keeping score. I would also like to revisit the code and try to keep it more concise and dynamic.
